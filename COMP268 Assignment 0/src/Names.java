/*
	ASSIGNMENT
	Create a class named “Names” that has the following field names. 
		firstName, middleName, and lastName. 
	Use appropriate datatypes to store values of these fields in Names objects. 
	Create appropriate get and set methods to retrieve and assign values to these names.
		For example, getMiddleName(vive) should return the middle name of the person Vive.
		Similarly, vive.setLastName(lName) should set the last name of the person Vive
		to the specified URL object. 
	Test your program for correct, partially correct (e.g., name String without the middleName),
		and incorrect inputs (e.g., name containing special characters). 
	Document your program thoroughly. 
	Create a profile of your program as you develop it (see “Program Profile” in Unit 0). 
	Ensure that your program addresses all marking rubrics (see “Assessments” in Unit 0). 
	Submit it to your tutor for marking.
